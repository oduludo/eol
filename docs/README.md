# EOL
Simple CLI application to check whether a tool's version has reached end-of-life (EOL).
EOL is designed primarily for usage in CI/CD pipelines, optionally giving an exit code if the EOL has passed.
But it can be used on your workstation as well.

EOL uses https://endoflife.date/ as a data source.
